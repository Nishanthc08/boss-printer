# Worklog – boss-printer

Target duration: **50 days** from project start.

Use this file as a running journal of what you did, what you decided, and any open questions.
Keep entries short but concrete. Example format is provided below.

---

## Day 1 – YYYY-MM-DD
- Created project directory structure.
- Drafted initial README, PROGRESS, and future enhancements docs.
- Decided on high-level goals and government-office focus.
- Open questions:
  - GTK vs Qt for GUI?
  - Rely only on CUPS CLI tools vs Python bindings?

## Day 2 – YYYY-MM-DD
- Example placeholder. Replace with real entries as you work.
- Notes:
  - Capture any issues you hit and how you solved them.

---

Going forward:
- Add one section per work session or per calendar day.
- Link key design decisions back to code (e.g., commit hashes) when helpful.
- Use this log to inform your final summary and documentation when the 50 days are up.
